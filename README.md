GTFS-Insight Vic uses PTV (Public Transport Victoria, Australia) GTFS, GTFS-Realtime, and the PTV Open Data API to analyse and visualise Victoria’s public transport network, and to build user-friendly maps with Leaflet that display routes, stops, wheelchair-accessible services, and live alerts, while I am also developing location-based features to identify nearby stops, present timetables, and indicate whether services are on time, early, delayed, or disrupted.
